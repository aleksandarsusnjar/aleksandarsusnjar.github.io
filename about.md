# About

I’m an engineer at heart-always thinking, always questioning.

When I encounter a new idea, I can't simply accept, memorize, and apply it. 
That might have worked in a different time and place, but not for me — and 
certainly not for innovation. I need to analyze, challenge, and form my own
conclusions, ideally aligning with the evidence presented. Unsupported and 
unexplained statements are just that—statements. They require scrutiny 
before they can be trusted and applied.

I created this space to document my thoughts and provoke yours, with the 
hope that, together, we can refine our understanding and make better decisions.
Just as tidying up a cluttered room can create temporary disorder, organizing
thoughts can feel messy at first. But that confusion isn't a setback; it’s a 
necessary step. It helps us dismantle misconceptions that hold us back, clearing
the way for deeper insight.
