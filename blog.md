Welcome to Cogitatorium - a place for thinking, questioning, and refining ideas. Quick, one-size-fits-all answers may be convenient, but they rarely stand the test of time or context. I've seen too many once-accepted truths become obsolete, and I know that no single perspective, mine included, can cover every situation. Instead of handing out conclusions, I share my thought process, challenging assumptions and inviting you to do the same. If that sparks new insights, better answers, or even more questions, then we're on the right path.
